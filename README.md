# GroovyTDD-BowlingKata
The famous Bowling Kata for learning TDD, written in Groovy and extended with further tests and code missing from the original kata. I created this in order to learn TDD, so apologies for any mistakes! If you find any, do tell me so I can fix them and get a better understanding of TDD myself.
