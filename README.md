# GroovyTDD-BowlingKata
The famous Bowling Kata for learning TDD(http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata), written in a Groovy manner and extended with further tests and code missing from the original kata. I created this in order to learn TDD, so apologies for any mistakes! If you find any, do tell me so I can fix them and get a better understanding of TDD myself. 
Using Spock for tests.

Individual tests are in branches (Test1, Test2, etc...). Master always contains newest version which passes all tests.
Progress on different tests is divided into individual commits.

Whether you're just looking for some Spock examples, or trying to figure out this TDD thing (like me), I hope this helps!
