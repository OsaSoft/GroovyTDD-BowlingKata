# GroovyTDD-BowlingKata
The famous Bowling Kata for learning TDD(http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata), written in a Groovy manner and extended with further tests and code missing from the original kata. I created this in order to learn TDD, so apologies for any mistakes! If you find any, do tell me so I can fix them and get a better understanding of TDD myself. 
Using Spock for tests.
