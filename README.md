# Groovy TDD Extended Bowling Game Kata
The famous Bowling Game Kata for learning TDD - Test Driven Development (http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata), written in a Groovy manner and extended with further tests and code missing from the original kata (the original doesnt even come close being able to support a proper game of bowling). I created this in order to learn TDD, so apologies for any mistakes! If you find any, do tell me so I can fix them and get a better understanding of TDD myself. Same goes for any recommendations for improvement!
Using Spock for tests (http://spockframework.github.io/spock/docs/1.1-rc-1/all_in_one.html).

Individual tests are in branches (Test1, Test2, etc...). Master always contains newest version which passes all tests.
Progress on different tests is divided into individual commits in their respecitive branches.

Whether you're just looking for some Spock examples, or trying to figure out this TDD thing (like me), I hope this helps!


PS. After almost 25 years of my life, I finally somewhat understand how the bowling scoring system works, yay!
Thanks to http://www.bowlinggenius.com/ for helping me figure out what the correct score is supposed to be whenever I wasnt sure.
